# Magic-Light-Controller

Don't really feel like describing this in great detail but this is a basic script that has the capability to control my smart lights. The brand name has magic in it but I forget the exact name. I may re-visit this later.

The protocol for the light commands is about 85% fully reversed. Other smart lights may have similar command/payload structures.
